# Welcome to the world of open education! 

**openSchool** is a semi-centralized open-source school platform that focuses on transparency to the user, stability and availability. Instead of being akin to cloud-based proprietary offerings by companies, which don't have a good privacy track record, openSchool runs on local servers / cloud-hosting providers of your choice, which means:

- Full ownership of **all** data without any prying eyes,
- Quicker response due to the lower number of users acccessing the same server,
- Outstanding privacy. openSchool **does not collect** any personalized metrics,
- Community-driven. Anyone can contribute to the development with a feature request or an implementation.
    
# What should be done:

- [x] The server-side software - the Core. Currently in prototyping stage and **NOT** production ready.
- [ ] The reference client app. WIP
- [ ] openSchool API Documentation, where we detail all the functionality of openSchool, how data should be handled and the small details. WIP.
